# **Human and Non-Human Profile Classification**

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset was originally used to train a CrowdFlower AI gender predictor. Contributors have been posting code and discussion on the [web](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-user-gender-classification) as well as [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/twitter-based-gender-classification-a-machine-learning-project/), [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/homayoonkhadivi/twitter-gender-classification-high-acc-69-56-nlp), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949719123000158), [here](https://github.com/tlaphane/Machine-Learning---Twitter-User-Gender-Classification), among others.

The dataset contains 20,050 rows, each with a username, a random tweet, account profile and image, location, and even link and sidebar colour. Detail dataset overview is available in “Twitter User Data.pdf” provided with the assignment instruction. 

## **Tasks** 
This project aims to find misinformation on social network, i.e., identify profiles that are mistakenly recorded as human/non-human profiles, focusing on the twitter_user_data dataset. Your essential tasks include the following Tasks 1-4: 
<br />
- **Task 1:** Design a big data analytics project by following Big Data Analytics Lifecycle.  
- **Task 2:** Process the data by considering the different data types and considering the various data properties. Correspondingly apply (mandatory) core models/algorithms. Consider, select, and justify the use of regression, association rules, clustering, classification, and text processing methods. 
- **Task 3:** Visualize the data and use visualization for the evaluation of results.
- **Task 4:** Study factors in multiple views/modes (e.g., text, colour, tweet, etc.) and make suggestion to amend non-human and human profiles.
